<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>
    The history of Goa dates back to prehistoric times, though the present-day state of Goa was only established as recently as 1987.
    [1] In spite of being India's smallest state by area, Goa's history is both long and diverse. It shares a lot of similarities with Indian history, especially with regard to colonial influences and a multi-cultural aesthetic.

The Usgalimal rock engravings, belonging to the upper paleolithic or mesolithic periods, exhibit some of the earliest traces of human
 settlement in India. The Mauryan and Satavahana Empires ruled modern-day Goa during the Iron Age.

During the medieval period, Goa was ruled by the Kadamba kingdom, Vijayanagara Empire, Bahmani Sultanate and Bijapur
 Sultanate.

<p>
    It was ruled by the Kadamba dynasty from the 2nd century CE to 1312 and by Muslims of the Deccan from 1312 to 1367. 
    The city was then annexed by the Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagara and was later conquered by the Bahmanī sultanate, which founded 
    Old Goa on the island in 1440.[2]

The Portuguese invaded Goa in 1510, defeating the Bijapur Sultanate. The Portuguese rule lasted for about 450 years, and heavily 
influenced Goan culture, cuisine, and architecture.

In 1961, India took control over Goa after a 36-hour battle and integrated it with the Indian Territory. 
The area of Goa was incorporated into Goa, Damaon & Diu, which included the Damaon territory in the north of the Konkan region. 
In 1987, following the Konkani language agitation Goa was granted statehood. 
Goa has one of the highest GDP per capita and Human Development Index among Indian states

    The Maratha Empire (1674-1818) to the north grew steadily in strength, far surpassing that of tiny Goa. After his escape from Aurangzeb in Agra, the Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji (1627-1680) started a counterattack to recoup lands lost to the Mughals through the Treaty of Purandar (1665). Against Goa, Chhatrapati Shivaji mounted an invasion that subdued the region adjoining the Old Conquestas. He 
    captured Pernem, Bicholim, Sattari, Ponda, Sanguem, Quepem and Canacona. Sawantwadi Bhonsale and Saudekar Rajas became his vassals.

The Maratha Chhatrapati Sambhaji (1657-1689), the son of C. Shivaji, tried in 1683 to conquer all of Goa. Chh. Sambhaji almost ousted the remaining Portuguese, but suddenly a Mughal army appeared which prevented the Maratha from completing their conquest. In 1739-1740 the territory of Bardez in north Goa was attacked by the Marathas, in order to pressure the Portuguese at Vasai. The plan of conquest, however, was forestalled with "the payment of a large war indemnity."[113][114]

In June 1756 a Maratha Army invading Goa killed in action Luís Mascarenhas, Count of Alva (Conde de Alva), the Portuguese Viceroy. The Marathas, however, soon met defeat in the distant north when confronting an Afghan invasion, at the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). The Maratha Peshwa's overall control slackened.[115] The Portuguese then defeated the Rajas of Sawantwadi and the Raja of Sunda to reconquer an area that stretched from Pernem to Canacona. This territory formed the Novas Conquistas, within the boundaries of present-day Goa.

Here you'll encounter a myriad of water sports, bustling beach shacks and friendly vendors, while the long stretch of white sand, backed by coconut palms and sand dunes, is filled with domestic and international tourists alike.

     from the beach inland
